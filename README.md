## What is Manga Translator?

Manga Translator is an intelligent workflow tool that automatically translates manga pages and books from one language to another. Whether you're a manga enthusiast who wants to read content in your preferred language, or you need to translate manga for accessibility purposes, this tool makes the process simple and efficient.

## Key Features

‚ú® **Multi-Language Support**: Translate between 25+ languages including Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Spanish, French, German, Korean, and many more

üöÄ **AI-Powered Translation**: Uses advanced AI models to provide accurate, context-aware translations that preserve the original meaning and style

üìñ **Flexible Input Options**:
- Translate single manga pages
- Process entire manga books (multiple images)
- Handle various image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP)

‚ö° **Hardware Acceleration**: Supports both CPU and CUDA (GPU) processing for faster translation speeds

üéØ **Smart Language Detection**: Automatically detects source language or allows manual specification

## How It Works

The Manga Translator uses sophisticated computer vision and natural language processing to:

1. **Detect Text**: Identifies text areas within manga images
2. **Extract Content**: Reads the original text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
3. **Translate**: Converts the text to your target language using AI translation models
4. **Replace**: Seamlessly replaces the original text with translated content while preserving the original layout and styling
